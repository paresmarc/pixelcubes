## #1 Project Alignment

Interventions: Research Project

- Create digital models through physical interaction
- How to transform a difficult process into a game
- How to define a DIY Kit to allow everyone to create 3D models
- Create a process between physical and digital.

We decided to continue the [first Challenge](https://github.com/paresmarc/tiledeco) and develop iterations to improve it and make it a more automatised process.

## #2 Project Development

Artifact Description:

- Physical Interactive space with cubes like pixels.
- Recombine the locations of cubes to create myriad combinations.
- Each cube has a Reactable Fiducial ID on each face.
- A camera connected to Firefly, Grasshopper detect and know the location and height of each cube.
- Once the cubes have the desired shape, the camera scans them and generates a volume.
- With that, you can export a 3D file and reproduce it with digital fabrication machines.

## #3 Final Product
