## #1 Project Alignment

Interventions: Research Project

- Create digital models through physical interaction
- How to transform a difficult process into a game
- How to define a DIY Kit to allow everyone to create 3D models
- Create a process between physical and digital.

We decided to continue the [first Challenge](https://github.com/paresmarc/tiledeco) and develop iterations to improve it and make it a more automated process.

## #2 Project Development

**Design Steps:**
1. Interactive physical modular system to create myriad volumes (cubes)
2. Research around webcam detection software of movement and rotation of shapes (Fiducial ID, Firefly)
3. How to combine and assemble cubes in order to create volumes (magnets, polarity)
4. Make the user interact with the Software. Incorporate Arduino (button to restart)
5.

Artifact Description:

- Physical Interactive space with cubes like pixels.
- Recombine the locations of cubes to create myriad combinations.
- Each cube has a Reactable Fiducial ID on each face.
- A camera connected to Firefly, Grasshopper detect and know the location and height of each cube.
- Once the cubes have the desired shape, the camera scans them and generates a volume.
- With that, you can export a 3D file and reproduce it with digital fabrication machines.

## #3 Final Product

* This project allowed us to improve the first Challenge, Tile Deco. With the Fiducial ID we are able to detect different types of shapes, the movement and rotation. Also, this system can digitalise and vectorize the shapes in an automatic process. This makes the design more straight forward and allow the user to center his attention on the design and see in live how the full pattern is looking in the digital.
